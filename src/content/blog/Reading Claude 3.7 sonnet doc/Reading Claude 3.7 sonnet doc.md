- **模型特点**
  - 开发优化，可集成：Claude 3.7 Sonnet shows particularly strong improvements in coding and front-end web development.
  - 可API调节思考时间：when using Claude 3.7 Sonnet through the API, users can also control the _budget_ for thinking: you can tell Claude to think for no more than N tokens, for any value of N up to its output limit of 128K tokens. This allows you to trade off speed (and cost) for quality of answer.
  - 混合模型，前沿推理更实用：Just as humans use a single brain for both quick responses and deep reflection, we believe reasoning should be an integrated capability of frontier models rather than a separate model entirely.
  - 标准模式是3.5 Sonnet的升级，拓展模式是反思后再深思的回答，两者prompt效果类似：We generally find that prompting for the model works similarly in both modes.
  
- **开放**
  - 标准模式全部开放：Claude 3.7 Sonnet is now available on all [Claude](https://claude.ai/new) plans—including Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise
  - 拓展思维不免费：Extended thinking mode is available on all surfaces except the free Claude tier.
